	<p>phpBB releases are time-based meaning we release a new minor (x.y) or major (x) update once every year around November/December. In between minor releases we release maintenance releases (x.y.z) which include bug and, when required, security fixes. On occasion we also release patch level releases (x.y.z-PLn) which fix important issues introduced in a maintenance release.</p>

	<h2>End of Life / End of Maintenance</h2>
	<p>End of Maintenance (EOM) occurs to a branch 18 months after it's first stable release (3.x.0) release. This occurs in May each year. When this occurs we:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Recommend you upgrade to the latest stable branch of phpBB</li>
		<li>Only patch security issues in new maintenance releases</li>
		<li>No longer allow new customisation [database] submissions except for updates to existing contributions</li>
	</ul>

	<p style="margin-top: 1em;">End of Life (EOL) occurs to a branch 24 months after it's first stable release (3.x.0) release. This occurs in November each year. When this occurs we:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strongly recommend you upgrade your version of phpBB to the latest stable release</li>
		<li>No longer patch security issues</li>
		<li>No longer make any releases of this branch</li>
		<li>No longer allow contributions or updates for contributions to be submitted to our customisation database</li>
		<li>Begin actively purging documentation for this branch of phpBB</li>
		<li>Support will continue to be provided past EOL, with at least six months notice prior to dropping support</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>phpBB 3.0.x (Olympus)</h2>
	<p>phpBB 3.0.x is a special case due to the length of it's time in 'maintenance period'. It will reach its 'End of Maintenance' period in May 2015 and its 'End of Life' period will occur in November 2015.<br /><br />When phpBB 3.0 has reached EOM the above will apply and new modificiations (MODs) will no longer be accepted for submissions into the customisation database whilst updates to existing MODs will be allowed. No new topics will be allowed in the MOD Reqeusts or MODs in Development fora. When 3.0 has reached EOL no new MOD updates will be permitted, they will be hidden from titania (allow downloable through the MOD Releases Forum still) and the MOD 3.0 forums will be locked.</p>

	<h2>Contributing</h2>
	<p>If you want to contribute a bug fix and it affects all maintained branches it will go into the next maintenance release of the lowest supported branch. Therefore it will likely go into the next phpBB 3.0.x release (<span class="github-link"> <a href="{{ dev_github_phpbb_30x }}">develop-olympus</a></span>) or for an 3.1.x only bug into the next phpBB 3.1.x release (<span class="github-link"> <a href="{{ dev_github_phpbb_31x }}">develop-ascraeus</a></span>).<br /><br />
		If you want to contribute a new feature it will go into the development branch and go into phpBB 3.2.0 (<span class="github-link"> <a href="{{ dev_github_phpbb_32x }}">develop</a></span>).</p>
