			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="admin-ui" href="#admin-ui">Admin Control Panel UI/UX</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>The phpBB Admin Control Panel user interface has been in use since the release of phpBB 3.0 in 2007. Naturally, its design is no longer up-to-date with the ever evolving design language of current websites. In addition to that, concerns about it being over-complex and not intuitive to use have been voiced before.</p>

			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="converter" href="#converter">Converter Framework</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>
				In addition to installation and updates from previous versions, phpBB also supports conversions from
				other forum software. However, converters usually can only target a certain software at a specific version.
				As a result, the possible conversion paths to phpBB are not as easy and straightforward as one might expect
				and usually requires an extra file that takes care of the actual conversion process. The goal of this project
				is to create a converter framework that can convert the database entries from any other BB software to phpBB's
				format with a simple configuration file that defines the "steps" it needs to take during the conversion process.
			</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a converter framework that can be easily adjusted to migrate database entries to phpBB</li>
				<li>Support the definition of migrations using a configuration file</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Knowledge Prerequisites</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Required: PHP, SQL</li>
				<li>Useful: Symfony, YAML, MySQL or similar</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="styleguide" href="#styleguide">Advanced Styleguide driven development(SDD) system</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>
				Build a NodeJS based app to view, interact with, and dynamically build/manage components in StyleGuides(phpBB theme).
			</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating a simple user interface (material design spec) for the app using suggested CSS/SCSS/Twig formats developed in conjunction with mentors for extracting data from files</li>
				<li>Must allow user to view example(s) of components and framework layer/partials while allowing for scaling between established breakpoints (<a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/#grid-options">Bootstrap Grid System</a>) of responsive design.</li>
				<li>Must allow viewing/editing of required files (SCSS, TWIG, JS), and allow for adding components.</li>
				<li>Must integrate into phpBB template system (be able to read from and manipulate within phpBB styles dir).</li>
				<li>Must be able to switch between styleguides.</li>
				<li>Must build all styleguides to mentor defined folder structure or allow for customization of folder structure.</li>
				<li>Must follow all coding standards set by mentors for SCSS, JS, TWIG. Project must use modern best practices and run on a NodeJS backend, relying on ExpressJS and or VueJS for routing & interface interactions.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Knowledge Prerequisites</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Required: Object-oriented design principles, Javascript, NodeJS, ExpressJS and/or VueJS 2.0, twig.js, GulpJS, JQuery, AJAX, SCSS, CSS, XHTML</li>
				<li>Useful: PHP, phpBB / phpBB Themes</li>

			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="moderator-tools" href="#moderator-tools">Improved moderator tools</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>
				Moderator actions within a topic like "Split topic" and "move posts" needs a detour through the MCP. Changing the mcp-tabs (Move posts, split topic etc.) won't change the select-input-field in mcp, too. This leads to a couner intuive behaviour.

				The idea is to add a checkbox to each post, make each post selectable and open a "alert"-similar popup to present the moderator options directly to the user. So select to posts, select "move posts" opens an alert-popup where you can look for and enter a topic ID. Split topic analog to that behaviour.

				In addition to that, possible improvements to moderation of topics and posts should be assessed and implemented in order of importance to give a moderators a more powerful and easy to use set of tools.
			</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Add a checkbox or similar way of selecting posts to split off or move to the topic view. This should be as intuitive as possible.</li>
				<li>Improve Moderator Control Panel usability, e.g. by reviewing interaction paths & usability</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Knowledge Prerequisites</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Required: Git, PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML</li>
				<li>Useful: CSS, previous phpBB experience</li>

			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="ad-management" href="#ad-management">Advertisement Management</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>The ability to easily handle advertisements in phpBB is often requested. Create a basic advertisement management extension that allows admins to add HTML/JS advertisement code to a number of predefined locations in the template.</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A validated phpBB extension which adds advertisement management to phpBB</li>
				<li>Allow admins to add HTML/JS advertisement code to predefined locations (ie: forum footer, header, after a topic's first post, etc.)</li>
				<li>If time allows: additional features such as hiding advertisements for specific groups, allow image banner uploads from the ACP, ability to set end dates for specific advertisements.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Knowledge Prerequisites</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Required: Object-oriented PHP, SQL, JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, Git</li>

			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="human-urls" href="#human-urls">Human Readable URLs</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>One of the most requested phpBB features is the ability to use human readable URLs. This extension should use the topic, forum and other page titles in the URL while still redirecting traditional URLs to these enhanced ones for backwards compatibility. (Also see the <a href="https://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=108&t=40965">RFC</a> at Area51)</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Add sanitised versions of topic and forum titles into the URLs</li>
				<li>Maintain backward compatibility so regular phpBB URLs created before the enabling of this extension will still be usable and redirect to the Human Readable URLs</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Knowledge Prerequisites</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Required: Object-oriented PHP, SQL, JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, Git</li>
				<li>Useful: phpBB Extensions system</li>

			<p>
				For non-website ideas, RFCs on <a href="{{ DEV_BOARD }}">Area51</a> are a good source of ideas as they represent what our users already told us they want. Most mentors are available in phpBB's IRC development channel <a href="{{ DEV_IRC_CHAT }}">#phpbb-dev</a> and on <a href="{{ DEV_BOARD }}">Area51</a>.
				For website ideas feel free to contact one of the website mentors (via IRC <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=phpbb-www">[#phpbb-www]</a> or email `website [at] phpbb [dot] com`).
			</p>
			<p>If you propose an original idea it will have a higher chance of being accepted if it satisfies the following two criteria:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Checkpointable</strong> -  it should be possible to break down your project into pieces that are by themselves meaningful. In practical terms, this means you should be sending a pull request every 1-2 weeks reflecting your work during that period, and the pull request should be individually mergeable. Avoid proposing a project that cannot be split into 1-2 week chunks.</li>
				<li><strong>Likely to be completed</strong> - this involves several factors, but at the end of the day the goal is for your work to be finished within the GSoC timeframe. You should start by detailing components of your project to sufficient extent that they can be estimated. Then, honestly estimate how long you think it will take you. Then double that estimate. If you exceed 3 months, your proposal is probably too ambitious and you should reduce its scope.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As always, if you are unsure about anything or have questions please don't hesitate to contact us. Also, please discuss your idea first before proposing it in your application.</p>
