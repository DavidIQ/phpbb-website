		<p>Junior Validators are extension authors that assist the Extension Customisations Team with the validation of extensions submitted to the phpBB.com Extension Database. The task of a Junior Validator is test submitted extensions which are in the Customisation Database Queue, and to offer feedback on how the validation is performed on the extension submitted.</p>

		<p>The Extension Customisations Team will select new Extension Customisations Team Validators primarily from the Junior Validators team. If you would like to become a Junior Validator, please read the requirements below, and if you meet them, you can apply to become a Junior Validator by contacting <a href="{{ ext_tl_contact }}">{{ ext_tl_name }}</a>.</p>

		<h3>What are the requirements?</h3>
